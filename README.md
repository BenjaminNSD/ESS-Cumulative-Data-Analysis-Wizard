# ESS-Cumulative-Data-Anlysis-Wizard
This is my first interactive dashboard using Dash! I hope you like it. 

In this Dashboard you can view line, bar and map charts of 50 ESS variables (ESS Cumlative data). 

The result is available from this website: http://beldebi.pythonanywhere.com/

The code is written in Python3.8, the main libraries are Pandas, Plotly and Dash.
